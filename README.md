UG4LuaCompletionProvider
=====================

The project source is available under the BSD 2-clause license printed below.

This project is part of an IDE for the UG4 shell created by the Goethe Center of Scientific Computing in Frankfurt.
The UG4 shell is a powerful tool for solving partial differential equations in two and three space dimensions.

This project contains rather specific code for creatin auto-completion suggestions for the function available in the
UG4 shell. It depends on closed source and won't work stand-alone.

In order to build this project, you need the projects RSyntaxTextArea and AutoComplete in the same directory as this project.
